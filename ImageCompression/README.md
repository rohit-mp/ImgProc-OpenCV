## Image Compression

The two types of compression:
- Haar 2d lossy compression
- Haar 2d lossless compression
are explored and their decompression is done.

The original image used:  
![Original Image](./image2.jpg)  

Lossy compression | Decompressed image obtained  
--- | ---  
![Lossy](./haar2d-lossy.jpg) | ![Lossy-inverse](./haar2d-lossy-inverse.jpg)  

Lossless compression | Decompressed image obtained  
--- | ---  
![Lossless](./haar2d-lossless.jpg) | ![Lossless-inverse](./haar2d-lossless-inverse.jpg)
